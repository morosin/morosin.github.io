title: Determining the Average High School English Curriculum using Google Trends

## Premise
One afternoon, I decided to re-read a favorite short story of mine, "The Cask of Amontillado" by Edgar Allen Poe. In finding an online copy, I stumbled across a [Know Your Meme entry](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/the-cask-of-amontillado) featuring a Google Trends graph for popularity of the terms "amontillado" and "the cask of amontillado" respectively.

### The Graph
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1457_RC03/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"the cask of amontillado","geo":"","time":"2004-01-01 2018-06-19"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&q=the%20cask%20of%20amontillado","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

A cursory analysis of the graph reveals peak periodicity in September or October of each year, with smaller peaks in February and consistent minima in April, June, and July, corresponding to the summer break of the traditional school year. I read "The Cask of Amontillado" as a freshman in high school, so I've decided to examine some other common reading material in the same manner.

## Analysis
### _The Great Gatsby_
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1457_RC03/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/0k2y7","geo":"","time":"2004-01-01 2018-06-19"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&q=%2Fm%2F0k2y7","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

This one comes out a bit muddled due to the release of a film in 2013, but we can still see periodic peaks in March and slightly higher in May, the latter corresponding with the end of the traditional school year.


### _Lord of the Flies_
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1457_RC03/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"/m/07s0_","geo":"","time":"2004-01-01 2018-06-19"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=all&q=%2Fm%2F07s0_","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

Perhaps one of the most common novels read in American high schools, this one shows most interest in May as well, closely followed by October and November.

_I'm not done, we're still working on this!_
